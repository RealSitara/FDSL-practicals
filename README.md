  b) List of students who play either cricket or badminton but not both 
  c) Number of students who play neither cricket nor badminton 
  d) Number of students who play cricket and football but not badminton. 
  (Note- While realizing the group, duplicate entries should be avoided, Do not use SET built-in functions)

  a) The average score of class 
  b) Highest score and lowest score of class 
  c) Count of students who were absent for the test 
  d) Display mark with highest frequency 

3) Write a Python program for department library which has N books, write functions for following: 
  a) Delete the duplicate entries 
  b) Display books in ascending order based on cost of books 
  c) Count number of books with cost more than 500. 
  d) Copy books in a new list which has cost less than 500.
